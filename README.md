# Smart_Charging_final_project
# Final Project CAPUEE

This project will involve the use of electric devices such as mobile phones and laptops in an office or home environment. The main goal is to control the charging period of these devices in order to avoid overcharging. Additionally, the charging of these devices will automatically be triggered during the night time when electricity prices are lower. The outcome of this project will allow devices such as mobile phones and computers to receive the exact amount of charge required to reach maximum capacity while ensuring efficient energy usage. The expected intention of this project is to hopefully create a ‘smart office’ where electricity is utilized in the most efficient way possible when it comes to charging of electric devices.
